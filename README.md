# Data Analysis & Visualisation

This repository contains projects focused on data analysis and visualization using tools such as **Excel, MATLAB, and Tableau**. Each project demonstrates different techniques for effective data representation.

## Projects

- [**Electric Vehicle Sales & Tennis Achievements**](./Electric%20Vehicles%20Sales/)<br>
    Visualizes electric vehicle sales data (2011â€“2023) and compares the achievements of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in tennis. Utilizes Excel and MATLAB to explore various graph types for clear and impactful visualization.

- [**Nested Treemap Visualization**](./Nested%20Treemap/)<br>
    Explores sales data visualization using nested treemaps in MATLAB and heatmap representations of mean temperature. Also demonstrates the use of Tableau for interactive data exploration.

- [**Principal Component Analysis on Flower Images**](./Principle%20Component%20Analysis/)<br>
    Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to classify images of flowers (dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip). Includes dimensionality reduction, visualization of eigenvectors, and matching of test images to the most similar training samples.
